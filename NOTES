Fix Window warning at launch.
    Bug in Xcode: http://www.openradar.me/35511761

Pop Window to front at launch.

Use of linewidth is sloppy.

When centering numbers in domain, center based on positive value so that
negative sign doesn't throw it off.

Draw first and last line of log graph if there are no numbers shown.

Header options:
    - Reference to other series.
    - Log (range).
